### Synopsis: 
##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">This research studies the effect of US interest rates on the macroeconomic condition of the EMEs. The study focuses on the reaction of exchange rates, broad money aggregates, and foreign exchange reserves to changes in US monetary policy. Here, we examine shadow interest rates as a monetary policy instrument in the United States. I first identify US monetary policy shocks in a US SVAR model. I then employ a Panel Structural Vector Autoregression (PSVAR) model, developed by Pedroni (2013), incorporating key economic indicators for 3 emerging markets over the period 2007â€“2022, and evaluate the dynamic responses of these variables to the shock in US shadow interest rates. Theoretically, a higher US interest rate means that the US dollar will strengthen, which could cause capital to flow out of EMEs.</font>

### Data: 
##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">Model 1: For identification of the US interest rate shocks, I use the monthly dataset from 2007 to 2022 for following data:

* Industrial Production Index (IPI)
* Consumer Price Index (CPI)
* Securities held outright by the Federal Reserve
* Shadow interest rates of the United States. </font> 

##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">Model 2: I use a monthly dataset from 2007 to 2020 for a total of 3 emerging economies (Russia, India and China) to examine the spillover effects of US interest rate shocks. The dataset consists: 
 
* IPI stands for Industrial Production Index, which is a measure of the physical output of the industrial sector of an economy

* CPI stands for Consumer Price Index, which is a measure of the average change in prices of goods and services consumed by households over time.

* Exchange rate refers to the value of one currency in relation to another currency. 

* Money supply (broad money) refers to the total amount of money in circulation in an economy, including physical currency and deposits in bank accounts. 

* Foreign exchange reserves refer to the foreign currencies held by a central bank or monetary authority as part of its monetary policy. 


Global database platform CEIC for collecting the data on all the variables.
