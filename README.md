### <font style="font-family: Arial">Problem Statement/Goal:</font> 


##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">Our paper studies the effect of US interest rates on the macroeconomic condition of the Emerging Market Economies (EMEs). The study focuses on the reaction of exchange rates, broad money aggregates, and foreign exchange reserves to changes in US monetary policy</font> 

### Motivation behind the project:
##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">1. How Money Works ? what is the architecture behind the working philosophy of money ? Who are the main players responsible for designing such mechanism?</font> 

##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">2. Once Step 1 was clear, it became evident to me raise awareness about this topic: "Inflation: The Biggest Export of the United States?"</font> 


### Data: 
##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">1. For identification of the US interest rate shocks, I use the monthly dataset from 2007 to 2020 on the Industrial Production Index (IPI), Consumer Price Index (CPI), securities held outright by the Federal Reserve, and shadow interest rates of the United States. </font> 

##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">2. I use a monthly dataset from 2007 to 2020 for a total of 29 emerging economies to examine the spillover effects of US interest rate shocks. The dataset consists of each EMEâ€™s IPI, CPI, exchange rate, money supply (broad money), and foreign exchange reserves. I use the global database platform CEIC for collecting the data on all the variables.

### High-level Planning of the project, e.g:

##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">-- Day 1: Strategy: matching the problem with the solution/Data Access</font> 


##### <font style="font-family: Georgia"> -- Day 2: Dataset preparation and preprocessing</font> 


##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">-- Day 3: Dataset splitting, Modeling Evaluating</font> 


##### <font style="font-family: Georgia">-- Day 4: Consolidate results and publish</font> --
